# Introduction
In here you learn how to build a simple, but fun game that runs on the blockchain from scratch: Tic Tac Toe.

I will cover everything from A to Z:

1. Solidity Basics, from the General File-Layout, Types, Events, Structs and Arrays and many more topics.
2. Development tools, such as Truffle, Web3/Truffle-Contract
3. Everything there is to know about different blockchains and nodes and how they operate
4. All you need to know about safely storing and sending/transferring Ether from or to Smart Contracts
5. And finally, how to test and publish this game live


# How To Run This Game
To run this game you and your opponent need access to the same blockchain. Either install MetaMask and choose the right network, or start your own blockchain node with go-ethereum or parity and connect to it.
